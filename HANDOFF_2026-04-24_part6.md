# Wander v1.0 — Handoff 2026-04-24 (part 6)

**Status:** First real-hardware field test of Phase 4d run by Steven on
the EvenRealities G2 (2026-04-24). Surfaced multiple high-priority
issues. Three small fixes deployed this session; the rest are documented
below for the next session — none of them block reading this doc.

**Latest commit:** `50feacd` — field-test label/units/cooldown fixes
**Tests:** 204/204 passing
**Vercel:** auto-redeployed on push

**Companion docs:**
- Field notes (raw): `/Users/stevenlao/CoworkSandbox/outbox/HARDWARE_TEST_NOTES_2026-04-24.md`
- Prior session: `HANDOFF_2026-04-24_part5.md`

## 1. What was fixed this session (commit 50feacd)

### 1.1 "Open in Safari" → "Open on Phone"
**Why:** EvenHub WebView opens external URLs in its own in-app browser,
not in Safari and not in the phone's default browser. The label was
misleading.

**Where:** `src/glasses/render.ts` `ACTION_LABEL.safari`. Internal
discriminant (`'safari'`) kept as-is to avoid touching state, types,
and routing — only the user-visible label changed.

### 1.2 NAV_ACTIVE imperial units
**Why:** Steven (US user) reported "Does 79 m mean meters?" — the NAV
body was metric while POI_DETAIL was already imperial.

**Where:** `src/glasses/render.ts` `formatMeters`. Now:
- `< 0.1 mi` → feet rounded to 5 ft (visual stability while updating)
- otherwise → `N.NN mi`

### 1.3 Scroll cooldown 300ms → 150ms
**Why:** Steven reported "scrolling feels laggy resulting in misinputs"
on real BLE.

**Where:** `src/glasses/bridge.ts` `SCROLL_COOLDOWN_MS`. Halved to give
intentional scrolls more headroom while still absorbing the worst
double-fires. Tune from here based on next session's feel.

## 2. Open issues — investigate next session

Ordered by impact. **None of these were fixed in this session** — they
need real hardware + logs to diagnose.

### 2.1 [BLOCKER] Boot stuck at title screen
**Symptom:** App opened to a title screen. Steven could only proceed
by long-pressing and *declining* an OS-level "End this Feature" prompt.

**Hypotheses:**
- Our LOADING screen renders, but the SDK's container handoff misfires
  on real BLE — the bridge thinks it's still booting.
- `createStartUpPageContainer` succeeded but the first `pois-loaded`
  dispatch never reached the bridge (geolocation hung past wall-clock?).
- The "title screen" Steven describes might be the EvenHub app's pre-app
  launcher, not Wander's LOADING screen — would explain why long-press
  was the only escape.

**Where to look:**
- `src/glasses/bridge.ts:64` `initGlasses` — the boot sequence
- `src/glasses/effects.ts:213` `defaultGeolocate` — 15s wall-clock race
  exists; verify it actually fires on hardware

**Recommended diagnostic:**
- Add a `console.log('[wander][boot]', step)` at each step of
  `initGlasses` so the next field test shows exactly where it hangs.
- Log the result of the first `geolocate()` call.

### 2.2 [HIGH] Only 1 POI returned ("Starbucks")
**Symptom:** From a presumably Vegas location, the list contained only
one item — a Starbucks. Expected: many.

**Hypotheses:**
- Wikipedia GeoSearch returned 0 (Vegas residential area) — only OSM
  contributed
- OSM Overpass query may have timed out and returned partial
- Category filter excluded everything else (settings.categories empty?)
- `MAX_RESULTS_TOTAL` clipping after distance sort
- New page-shape envelope on `/api/poi` may be returning `items: []`
  occasionally if Vercel function logs show errors

**Where to look:**
- `api/poi.ts` — server-side merge + filter logic
- Vercel function logs for the deployment around the test time
- `src/glasses/state.ts` `INITIAL_STATE.settings.categories` — should
  default to all 8

**Recommended diagnostic:**
- Add server-side logging in `api/poi.ts`: count of wiki items, OSM
  items, post-filter, post-slice. Visible in Vercel function logs.
- Log the `?categories=` query string to confirm the client is sending
  all categories.

### 2.3 [HIGH] Double-tap unresponsive on POI_DETAIL / NAV_ACTIVE
**Symptom:** Phase 1 fix (treat undefined eventType as CLICK) was meant
to fix this. On real BLE, double-tap still doesn't surface CONFIRM_EXIT.

**Hypotheses:**
- DOUBLE_CLICK_EVENT might also deserialize to undefined (not just
  CLICK_EVENT). Currently we only normalize undefined → CLICK.
- The SDK might never deliver DOUBLE_CLICK_EVENT and instead delivers
  two separate CLICK_EVENTs that the host app's debouncer collapses.
- The OS-level long-press is intercepting before our handler.

**Where to look:**
- `src/glasses/bridge.ts:58` `normalizeEventType` — currently only maps
  undefined → CLICK
- `src/glasses/bridge.ts:189` `translateGlassesEvent` — DOUBLE_CLICK
  case
- Phase 0 diagnostic at `bridge.ts:201-220` already logs `eventType` —
  next field test must capture these logs to see what's actually
  arriving.

**Recommended diagnostic:**
- Get logs working first (§2.7), then re-run hardware test and capture
  what eventType comes through on a deliberate double-tap.
- Consider adding a manual double-tap detector: track CLICK_EVENT
  timestamps and treat two within 350ms as DOUBLE_CLICK regardless of
  the SDK's reported type.

### 2.4 [HIGH] "Back to List" doesn't return to POI_LIST
**Symptom:** Tapping "Back to List" from POI_ACTIONS only returned to
POI_DETAIL of the same Starbucks.

**Hypotheses:**
- `executePoiDetailAction` `case 'back'` calls `applyPendingRefresh`
  which uses `pendingPoiRefresh ?? state.poiList`. If `poiList` only
  has the Starbucks (because §2.2), back-nav lands on a 1-item list —
  which Steven may be misreading as "the same Starbucks detail."
- This is likely a *symptom* of §2.2, not a separate bug. Confirm by
  fixing §2.2 first.

**Where to look:** `src/glasses/state.ts:513` `case 'back'` →
`applyPendingRefresh` → `next(state, { name: 'POI_LIST', pois, ... })`.

### 2.5 [MEDIUM] "Open on Phone" locks glasses cursor
**Symptom:** After tapping "Open on Phone", the in-app browser opens
on the phone and the glasses cursor can no longer move off that menu
item.

**Diagnosis (high confidence):** EvenHub's in-app browser overlay
captures input. While it's foregrounded, scroll/tap events go to the
browser, not Wander. Glasses still display POI_ACTIONS but inputs
aren't reaching us.

**Options:**
- (a) Accept the platform behavior; add a hint on the action like
  "Open on Phone (return via phone)".
- (b) Investigate whether the EvenHub SDK exposes a method to open
  URLs in the system browser (Safari proper) instead of the in-app
  one — that would background EvenHub and avoid the input capture.
- (c) Drop the action entirely and rely on Read More + Navigate.

**Recommendation:** (a) for v1, (b) for a follow-up if SDK supports it.

### 2.6 [MEDIUM] Scrolling still feels laggy
**Symptom:** Field test reported lag at 300ms. We dropped to 150ms
this session — untested on hardware yet.

**Plan:** Re-run scroll test next session. If still laggy, drop to
0 (disabled) and rely on the SDK to debounce. If bounces leak through,
go back to 150–200ms.

### 2.7 [HIGH — DIAGNOSTIC] Console logs not visible
**Symptom:** Steven couldn't see any `[wander][evt]` or `[wander]` logs
on phone or glasses. Without logs, all the above issues are blind.

**Question to answer first thing next session:** *How does Steven view
console output during a real-hardware run?*

**Possibilities:**
- Chrome DevTools remote debugging on the EvenHub app's WebView
- EvenHub's developer console / log viewer
- Adding an on-screen debug overlay (last 5 log lines as a screen-
  bottom strip in DEV builds only)

If remote debugging isn't accessible, add an on-screen debug overlay
gated on `import.meta.env.DEV` so the next field test can see what's
happening without DevTools. This is the highest-ROI single change for
diagnosing everything else.

## 3. Recommended order of attack next session

1. **Get logs visible** (§2.7) — without this, every other
   investigation is guesswork. Either find the EvenHub debug console
   or add an on-screen overlay.
2. **Re-run field test** with logs now flowing. Capture `[wander][evt]`
   for every double-tap and scroll, and the boot sequence logs.
3. **Investigate §2.1 boot stuck** — should be obvious from boot logs.
4. **Investigate §2.2 1-POI** — server logs from Vercel + the
   client-side categories query string should explain it.
5. **Fix §2.3 double-tap** based on what eventType actually arrives.
6. **Verify §2.4** is just a symptom of §2.2 (likely).
7. **Decide §2.5** policy (label hint, alternate URL opener, or drop).

---

## 4. What NOT to touch

These are working per the field test:

- **POI_DETAIL → NAV_ACTIVE flow** — Navigate works
- **Minimap PNG render** — user-position triangle visible on glasses
- **POI_DETAIL header layout** — fits the screen, distance/walk-time/
  bearing display correctly
- **Cursor highlight visibility** — `>` prefix is clearly visible
- **Category icons** — render correctly
- **Text fits 576×288** — no overflow
